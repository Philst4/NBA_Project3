MODEL TESTS (using only team data):
* Got to 64% accuracy using PLUS_MINUS alone ...
* * only need 'for', 'ag' is inverse of 'for' by definition
* LOGISTIC REGRESSION (sklearn)
* * Reached 67% using PLUS_MINUS and IS_HOME (with scaled data)
* * * Marginally better results using all other stats
* * * Reached roughly same marks with unscaled data
* * * takes way longer to train with unscaled, so worth using scaled
* RANDOM FOREST
* * Also reached 66-67%
* GBM
* * 67+%

# Notes from NBA Project 2
* Didn't properly implement a neural network (yet)
* Don't need to use ALL streak data (0 should suffice)

* FG3_PCT on its own may be bad, want 3PA as well (data skewed by season)
* Same with FG2_PCT, want 2PA



#####
Notes from NBA API:
* First season with data is '1983-84', up to current data
* Features are:

'SEASON_ID', 'TEAM_ID', 'TEAM_ABBREVIATION', 'TEAM_NAME', 'GAME_ID',
       'GAME_DATE', 'MATCHUP', 'WL', 'MIN', 'PTS', 'FGM', 'FGA', 'FG_PCT',
       'FG3M', 'FG3A', 'FG3_PCT', 'FTM', 'FTA', 'FT_PCT', 'OREB', 'DREB',
       'REB', 'AST', 'STL', 'BLK', 'TOV', 'PF', 'PLUS_MINUS'

* Seem to be certain games where 3pt percentage isn't tracked; PLUS_MINUS isn't tracked at all early on


* Season id's are 5 digits, preceded by a digit that indicates what type of games 
* Season id's first digit being '2' indicates regular season
* Some seasons have more games than 82 under the regular season index than possible
* * Solution: take 82-game head

* leaguegamefinder returns a dataframe list of length 1
