WHEN TO TAKE A BET:
* Risk tolerance (false positives vs false negatives)
* Utility function
* Use ML to learn decision thresholds?
* Do a sensitivity analysis?




FILE STRUCTURE 

* /data
* * read.py (read in data from NBA_API)
* * clean.py (put in NaN values, add 'IS_HOME' feature)
* * mirror.py (turn into 'for', 'against') => eventually used as targets
* * streak.py (turn into:
             'for_prev_k_A', 'against_prev_k_A',
             'for_prev_k_B', 'against_prev_k_B' ) => eventually used as inputs
            * make a dset for each k-value, ideally. Worry about merging later.
            * don't duplicate mirror.csv data. 
* * /raw
* * * raw.csv
* * /unscaled
* * * clean.csv
* * * mirror.csv (aka targets.csv)
* * * streak_k.csv (for all k's)
* * /scaled
* * * clean.csv
* * * mirror.csv (aka targets.csv)
* * * streak_k.csv (for all k's)

... more feature selection, feature engineering ... 

* /modeling (stuff for building models)
* * /models (contains the model types)
* * train
* * test
* main.py (for running everything)
