MODEL TESTS:
* Got to 64% accuracy using PLUS_MINUS alone ...
* * only need 'for', 'ag' is inverse of 'for' by definition
* LOGISTIC REGRESSION (sklearn)
* * Reached 67% using PLUS_MINUS and IS_HOME (with scaled data)
* * * Marginally better results using all other stats
* * * Reached roughly same marks with unscaled data
* * * takes way longer to train with unscaled, so worth using scaled
* RANDOM FOREST
* * Also reached 66-67%
* GBM
* * 67+%
